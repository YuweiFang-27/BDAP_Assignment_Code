# Factors affecting the severity of traffic accidents
This repository contains a three-part project analyzing factors influencing the severity of traffic accidents in Victoria, Australia. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, clustering, and supervised modeling.

## Project Structure
1. Part A.ipynb —— Data preprocessing and initial exploration.
2. Part B.ipynb —— Exploratory visualisation, PCA, and clustering.
3. Part C.ipynb —— Supervised learning with logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost for severity prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset is derived from publicly available Victorian traffic accident data and includes information on accident type, speed zone, light condition, road geometry, and more.

### Raw Data (`raw_data.zip`)
- `accident.csv`
- `road_surface_cond.csv`
- `atmospheric_cond.csv`
- `accident_merged.csv` —— Merged dataset using `ACCIDENT_NO` as key

### Cleaned Dataset
- `accident_cleaned.csv` – Final dataset after data cleaning
